Definition: Components are individual, reusable UI elements that can be combined to create a user interface. They often include buttons, form fields, modals, navigation bars, and other elements.
Purpose: Components are designed to be directly implemented in code and are usually documented with examples, usage guidelines, and best practices.
Characteristics: Each component often has defined states (like hover, active, disabled) and can be customized with properties (like size, color, or text).
